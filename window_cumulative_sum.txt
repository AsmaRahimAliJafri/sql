# question from https://www.machinelearningplus.com/sql/sql-window-functions-exercises/


-- solution 1 -> incorrect, I couldn't use lag function because the default value has to be a constant integer and not a subquery
# select * ,
# lag(qty,1, 0 )
# over() as cumQty
# from demand2

-- solution 2
# SELECT day, 
#        qty,
#        SUM(qty) OVER(ORDER BY day) as cumQty 
# FROM demand2;
